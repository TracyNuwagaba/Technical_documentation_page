                    <strong>Javascript</strong>&reg; &#40;often shortened
                    to <strong>JS</strong>&#41; is a lightweighted, interpreted,
                    object-oriented language with first class functions, and is best
                    known as the scripting language for web pages but it's also used in
                    many non-browser environments.
                </p> <br>

                <p>
                    Javascript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used
                    to design or program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of
                    an event. Javascript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting
                    language widely used for controlling web behavior. 
                </p> <br>

                <p>
                    Contrary to the misconception, <strong>Javascript is 
                    <em>not</em> interpreted as Java</strong>. The basic
                    syntax is intentionally similar to Java to reduce the
                    number of new concepts required to learn the language.
                    Language constructs such as if statements, for and while
                    loops, switch, and try and catch blocks function the same. 
                </p> <br>

                <p>
                    However, Javascript can function as both a procedural and
                    object-oriented language. Objects are created programmatically
                    in Javascript by attaching methods and properties to the empty 
                    objects <strong>at run time</strong> as opposed to class definitions
                    in Java. Once an object has been constructed, it can be used as a
                    blueprint or prototype for creating similar objects.

                To get started with Javascript, open your text editor
                and write your first "Hello World" Javascript code in
                the script tags or external file:
                <pre><code>document.write("Hello World");</code></pre>

                Open the file in your broswer and you will see the output.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Comments are lines of code that Javascript will intentionally
                    ignore. They are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to
                    other people to figure out what the code does. 
                </p> <br>
                
                <p>There are two ways to write comments in Javascript:</p> <br>
                
                <p>
                    Using // will tell Javascript to ignore the remainder
                    of the text on the current line.
                </p>
                <pre><code>// This is an in-line comment</code></pre> <br>
                
                <p>
                    You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /*
                    and ending with */
                </p>
                <pre><code>/* This is a multi-line comment */</code></pre> <br>
                <p>
                    It is a good practice to regularly add comments to clarify the 
                    function of parts of your code.

                    Javascript variables are containers for storing data
                    values. The names of variables called identifiers may not
                    contain spaces or start with numbers but must begin with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A letter &#40;A&ndash;Z or a&ndash;z&#41;</li>
                    <li>A dollar sign &#40;$&#41;</li>
                    <li>Or an underscore &#40;_&#41;</li>
                </ul> <br>

                <p>Javascript variables are declared in three ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        With the var keyword: This can be used to declare
                        both local and global variables. Global variables
                        are declared outside the function and can be accessed
                        from anywhere in the program where as the local variables are
                        declared within the function and can only be accessed from 
                        inside the function where they are declared.
                        <pre><code>var age = 24;</code></pre> <br>
                        Variables declared with the var keyword can be 
                        redeclared and cannot have block scope. Variables 
                        declared with var inside <b>{}</b> can be accessed 
                        from outside the block.
                        <pre><code>{
                            var x = 10;
                            // Can be accessed and used outside the scope 
                        }</code></pre>
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        With the let keyword: Variables defined with the let
                        keyword have block scope. Variables declared with let
                        inside <b>{}</b> cannot be accessed from outside the block.
                        <pre><code>{
                            let firstName = "John";
                            // Cannot be accessed and used outside the scope 
                        }</code></pre> 
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        With the const keyword: Const is used to define variables that 
                        cannot be reassigned and have to be initialised with a value. 
                        Such variables are constant(read only).
                        <pre><code>const PI = 3.14;
                            PI = PI + 10; // This will give an error
                        </code></pre> <br>
                        Declaring a variable with const is similar to let when 
                        it comes to Block scope. <br>
                        The x declared in the block in this example is not the same
                        as the x declared outside the block:
                        <pre><code>var x = 10;
                            // Here x is 10
                            {
                                const x = 5;
                                // Here x is 5
                            }
                            // Here x is 10
                        </code></pre>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    In programming, data types is an important concept.
                    Javascript variables can hold many data types forexample:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Primitive data types: These data types have a single simple
                            data value with no additional properties and methods. Javascript
                            has seven primitive data types and these include numbers, 
                            booleans, strings, undefined, null, bigint and symbol.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            A String: It is a series of characters. Strings 
                            are written with double quotes. You can use single
                            or double quotes. Strings are used to represent 
                            textual data.
                            <pre><code>var name = "John Doe";</code></pre>
                        </li>

                            <pre><code>var x1 = 34;

                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Booleans: Booleans can only have two values, true
                            or false. Booleans are often used in conditional 
                            testing.
                            <pre><code>var x = 5;

                                (x == y) // Returns true
                                (x == z) // Returns false

                            <pre><code>var car; // value and type are undefined</code></pre>
                            An empty value has nothing to do with undefined for example:
                            <pre><code>var car = ""; // value is "", the typeof is "string"</code></pre>

                            that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. You can 
                            safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe
                            integer limit for Number data type. <br>
                            A BigInt is created by appending <b>n</b> to the end of the integer
                            or by calling the constructor.

                            objects and so we refer to them collectively as objects.

                            order to access and modify data we use properties 
                            instead of indexes. Objects store data in a structured way.
                            Objects are written as key-value pairs separated by commas.

                            to a procedure that performs a task. It should take some

                <p>
                    Conditional statements are used to make decisions in code. A 
                    conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a 
                    specified condition is true. Javascript supports two conditional
                    statements: <b>if...else</b> and <b>switch</b>
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    Use the <strong>if</strong> statement to execute a statement if 
                    a logical condition is true. Use the <strong>else</strong> clause
                    to execute a statement if the condition is false for example:
                </p>
                <pre><code>if (condition) {
                    statement_1;
                } else {
                    statement_2;
                }</code></pre> <br>
                <p>
                    You can also compound the statements using <strong>else if</strong>
                    to have multiple conditions tested in sequence.
                </p>
                <pre><code>if (condition_1) {
                    statement_1;
                } else if (condition_2) {
                    statement_2;
                } else if (condition_3) {
                    statement_3;
                } else {
                    statement_last;
                }</code></pre> <br>
                <p>
                    Switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.
                </p>
                <pre><code>switch(expression) {
                    case x:
                        // code block
                        // break;
                    case y:
                        // code block
                        // break;
                    default:
                        //code block
                    }</code></pre>

            <article>
                <p>Javascript has the following type of operators:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Assignment Operator. It assigns a value to its left
                        operand based on the value of its right operand.
                        <pre><code>var x = 10;</code></pre> <br> 
                        There are also compound assignment operators for example:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-list">Addition Assignment(+=)</li>
                        <li class="sub-list">Subtraction Assignment(-=)</li>
                        <li class="sub-list">Multiplication Assignment(*=)</li>
                        <li class="sub-list">Division Assignment(/=)</li>
                        <li class="sub-list">Remainder Assignment(%=)</li>
                        <li class="sub-list">Exponentiation Assignment(**=)</li>
                    </ul> <br>
                    <li>
                        Arithmetic Operators. They are used to perform arithmetic 
                        on numbers. They take numerical values as their operands and
                        return a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic 
                        operators are addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*)
                        and division(/). In addition to the standard arithmetic operators,
                        Javascript provides the following arithmetic operators.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Remainder(%). A binary operator that returns the integer 
                            remainder of the two operands
                            <pre><code>12 % 5 // returns 2</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Increment(++). A unary operator that adds one to its 
                            operand. If used as a pre-increment(++x), returns the value
                            of its operand after adding one. If used as a post-increment
                            (x++), returns the value of its operand before adding one.
                        </li>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Decrement(--). A unary operator that substracts one from 
                            its operand. The pre-decrement and post-decrement work the 
                            same way as pre-increment and post-increment respectively.
                        </li>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Exponentiation(**). Calculates the base to the exponent power,
                            that is base<sup>exponent</sup>
                            <pre><code>2 ** 3 // returns 8</code></pre>
                        </li>

                    <li>
                        Comparison Operators. A comparison operator compares its operands
                        and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true
                        for example:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Equal(==). Returns true if the operands are equal.

                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Not equal(!=). Returns true if the operands are not equal.

                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Strict equal(===). Returns true if the operands are equal and 
                            of the same type.
                        </li>

                            Strict not equal(!==). Returns true if the operands are of the

                        </li>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Greater than(>). Returns true if the left operand is greater than 
                            the right operand.

                    <li>
                        Logical operators. They are typically used with boolean values and 
                        return a boolean value. However when used with a non boolean value, 
                        they may return a non boolean value for example:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Logical AND(&&). Returns true if both operands are true, otherwise
                            returns false.
                        </li>
                        <li class="sub-list">
                            Logical OR(||). Returns true if either operand is true. If both

                    Loops offer a quicky and easy way to perform tasks 
                    repeatedly. Loops provided in Javascript are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A for loop. It repeats until a specified condition 
                        evaluates to false.
                    </li>
                    <pre><code>for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; incrementExpression) {
                        statement
                    }</code></pre>
                    <li>
                        Do while loop. It is always executed once before the condition is 
                        checked. When the condition is true, the statement executes again and 
                        when it's false, the execution stops.
                        <pre><code>do {
                            // code block to be executed
                        } while(condition);</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A while loop. Executes its statement as long as a specified condition 
                        evaluates to true. If the condition becomes false, statement within the 
                        loop stops executing.
                    </li>
                    <pre><code>while (condition) {
                        statement;
                    }</code></pre>
